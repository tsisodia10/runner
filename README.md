# PYTHON TASK 

A python script which wraps a command( say example : "ping" ) in our case and does the following things -

1) -c      : This should tell us the number of times a command should be run
2) -failed : This argument should tell us that how many times a command should be run before giving up
3) -debug  : This mode runs the command in "debug" mode
4) -help   : This should show us the manual
5) -strace : Strace is used for Disk and Memory tracing
6) -pingparsing : It shows the system calls and transmitted packets in json format
